I am  **[Vaishnav Potlapalli](https://github.com/va1shn9v)** , a computer vision and Machine learning Enthusiast currently working as a ML engineer at Dhan AI, where I work on building conversational AI. I am intrested in self supervised learning and Generative Modelling .I love reading in my freetime and I am what you would refer to as a news junkie. I can talk to you about anime for as long as you want. Playing Dota 2 makes me Salty.
