Hi,I am  **[Vaishnav Potlapalli](https://github.com/va1shn9v)** , a computer vision and Machine learning Enthusiast currently working as a ML engineer at Dhan AI, where I work on building conversational AI Agents. My intrests lie in the fields of self-supervised learning and Generative Modelling,largely motivated by Yann Lecun's Cake analogy. I enjoy working on challenging problems in CV/ML.

In my free time I like to read and I am what you would refer to as a news junkie. I can talk to you about anime for as long as you want and playing Dota 2 makes me salty.
